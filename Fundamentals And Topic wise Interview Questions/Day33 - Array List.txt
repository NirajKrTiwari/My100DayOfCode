Java ArrayList
---------------
The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.

The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). 
While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want. The syntax is also slightly different:

Example:
Create an ArrayList object called cars that will store strings:

import java.util.ArrayList; // import the ArrayList class

ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>(); // Create an ArrayList object
If you don't know what a package is, read our Java Packages Tutorial.

Add Items
The ArrayList class has many useful methods. For example, to add elements to the ArrayList, use the add() method:

Access an Item
To access an element in the ArrayList, use the get() method and refer to the index number:

Example
cars.get(0);

Remember: Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.

Change an Item
To modify an element, use the set() method and refer to the index number:

Example
cars.set(0, "Opel");

Remove an Item
To remove an element, use the remove() method and refer to the index number:

Example
cars.remove(0);

To remove all the elements in the ArrayList, use the clear() method:

Example
cars.clear();

ArrayList Size
To find out how many elements an ArrayList have, use the size method:

Example
cars.size();
